A simple triple flame
=====================

Introduction
------------

Laminar flames have the potential to reveal the fundamental structure of combustion
without the added complexities of turbulence.
They also aid in our understanding of the more complex turbulent flames.
Depending on the fuel involved and the flow configuration, the laminar flames can take on a number of interesting geometries.
For example, as practical combustion systems often operate in partially premixed mode,
with one or more fuel injections, a wide range of fresh gas compositions can be observed;
and these conditions favor the appearance of edge flames, see :numref:`TripleFlameIntro`.

   : Normalized heat release rate (top) and temperature (bottom) contours of two-dimensional (2D) laminar lifted flames of ethylene.

Edge flames are composed of lean and rich premixed flame wings usually surrounding a central
anchoring diffusion flame extending from a single point [PCI2007]_. Edge flames play
an important role in flame stabilization, re-ignition and propagation.
Simple fuels can exhibit up to three burning branches while diesel fuel, with a low temperature combustion mode,
can exhibit up to 5 branches.

The goal of this ``TripleFlame`` tutorial is to setup a simple 2D laminar triple edge flame configuration with `PeleLMeX`.
This document provides step by step instructions to properly set-up the domain and boundary conditions,
construct an initial solution, and provides guidance on how to monitor and influence the initial transient to reach
a final steady-state solution.

Test case and boundary conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed on a 2x4 :math:`cm^2` 2D computational domain
using a 64x128 base grid and up to 4 levels of refinement (although we will start with a lower number of levels).
The refinement ratio between each level is set to 2. With 4 levels, this means that the minimum grid size inside the reaction layer will be just below 20 :math:`μm`.
The maximum box size is fixed at 32, and the base (level 0) grid is composed of 8 boxes,
as shown in :numref:`TF_SetupGeom`.

Symmetric boundary conditions are used in the transverse (:math:`x`) direction, while ``Inflow`` (dirichlet)
and ``Outflow`` (neumann) boundary conditions are used in the main flow direction (:math:`y`). The flow goes
from bottom to top. The specificities of the ``Inflow`` boundary condition are explained in hereafter.

   :align: center
   :figwidth: 95%

   : Sketch of the computational domain with level 0 box decomposition (left) and input mixture fraction profile (right).

The geometry of the problem is specified in the first block of the ``input.2d-regt``: ::

   #---------------------- DOMAIN DEFINITION ------------------------
   geometry.is_periodic = 0 0                # For each dir, 0: non-perio, 1: periodic
   geometry.coord_sys   = 0                  # 0 => cart, 1 => RZ
   geometry.prob_lo     = 0.0 0.0 0.0        # x_lo y_lo (z_lo)
   geometry.prob_hi     = 0.02 0.04 0.0      # x_hi y_hi (z_hi)

The second block determines the boundary conditions. Refer to Fig :numref:`TF_SetupGeom`: ::

   #---------------------- BC FLAGS ---------------------------------
   # Interior, Inflow, Outflow, Symmetry,
   # SlipWallAdiab, NoSlipWallAdiab, SlipWallIsotherm, NoSlipWallIsotherm
   peleLM.lo_bc = Symmetry Inflow            # bc in x_lo y_lo (z_lo)
   peleLM.hi_bc = Symmetry Outflow           # bc in x_hi y_hi (z_hi)

The number of levels, refinement ratio between levels, maximum grid size as well as other related refinement parameters are set under the third block  : ::

   #---------------------- AMR CONTROL ------------------------------
   amr.n_cell          = 64 128              # Level 0 number of cells in each direction
   amr.max_level       = 1                   # maximum level number allowed
   amr.ref_ratio       = 2 2 2 2             # refinement ratio
   amr.regrid_int      = 2                   # how often to regrid
   amr.n_error_buf     = 1 1 2 2             # number of buffer cells in error est
   amr.grid_eff        = 0.7                 # what constitutes an efficient grid
   amr.blocking_factor = 16                  # block factor in grid generation (min box size)
   amr.max_grid_size   = 32                  # max box size

Problem specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The edge flame is stabilized against an incoming mixing layer with a uniform velocity profile. The mixing
layer is prescribed using an hyperbolic tangent of mixture fraction :math:`z` between 0 and 1,
as can be seen in :numref:`TF_SetupGeom`:

.. math::

    z(x) = 0.5 \Big(1 + tanh \Big( \frac{x - 0.6(x_{hi} + x_{lo})}{0.05(x_{hi} - x_{lo})} \Big) \Big)

where :math:`z` is based on the classical elemental composition [CF1990]_:

.. math::

    z =  \frac{\beta - \beta_{ox}}{\beta_{fu} - \beta_{ox}}

where :math:`\beta` is Bilger's coupling function, and subscript :math:`ox` and :math:`fu` correspond
to oxidizer and fuel streams respectively.

Specifying dirichlet ``Inflow`` conditions in `PeleLMeX` can seem daunting at first. But it is actually a very
flexible process. We walk the user through the details of it for the Triple Flame case just described. The files involved are:

- ``pelelmex_prob_parm.H``, assemble in a C++ struct ``ProbParm`` the input variables as well as other variables used in the initialization process.
- ``pelelmex_prob.cpp``, initialize and provide default values to the entries of ``ProbParm`` and allow the user to pass run-time value using the `AMReX` parser (``ParmParse``). In the present case, the parser will read the parameters in the ``Problem`` block: ::

    #---------------------- Problem ----------------------------------
    prob.P_mean = 101325.0
    prob.T_in = 300.0
    prob.V_in = 0.85
    prob.Zst = 0.055

- finally, ``pelelmex_prob.H`` contains the ``pelelmex_initdata`` and ``bcnormal`` functions responsible for generating the initial and boundary conditions, resspectively.

Note that in our specific case, we compute the input value of the mass fractions (Y) *directly* in ``bcnormal``,
using the ``ProbParm`` variables. We do not need any additional information, because we hard coded the hyperbolic
tangent profile of :math:`z` (see previous formula) and there is a direct relation with the mass fraction profiles.
The interested reader can look at the function ``set_Y_from_Ksi`` and ``set_Y_from_Phi`` in ``pelelmex_prob.H``.

Looking closely at the ``ProbParm`` struct, we can see that an object specific to
`PeleLMeX` is present, a ``FlowControllerData`` named ``FCData``: ::

    struct ProbParm
    {
        amrex::Real P_mean = 101325.0_rt;
        amrex::Real splitx = 0.0;
        amrex::Real midtanh = 0.001;
        amrex::Real widthtanh = 0.001;
        amrex::Real Zst = 0.05;
        amrex::Real T_in = 300.0;
        amrex::Real V_in = 0.4;

        int bathID{-1};
        int fuelID{-1};
        int oxidID{-1};

        FlowControllerData FCData;
    };

This tutorial will use `PeleLMeX` active control capabilities for which having this object in ``ProbParm`` is necessary (and checked during initialization).
As the simulation proceeds, the data in that container will be updated and used in ``bcnormal`` to modify the inlet velocity.

Initial solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An initial field of the main variables is always required to start a simulation.
Ideally, you want for this initial solution to approximate the final (steady-state in our case) solution as much as possible.
This will speed up the initial transient and avoid many convergence issues.
In the present tutorial, an initial solution is constructed by imposing the same inlet hyperbolic tangent of
mixture fraction than described in subsection :ref:`sec:TUTO_TF::InflowSpec` everywhere in the domain,
and reconstructing the species mass fraction profiles from it.
To ensure ignition of the mixture, a progressively widening Gaussian profile of temperature is added,
starting from about 1 cm, and stretching until the outlet of the domain. The initial temperature field is
shown in Fig :numref:`TF_InitialSol`, along with the parameters controlling the shape of the hot spot.

.. figure:: images/tutorials/TF_InitialSol.png
   :name: TF_InitialSol
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 95%

   : Initial temperature field (left) as well as widening gaussian 1D y-profiles (right) and associated parameters. The initial solution contains 2 levels.

This initial solution is constructed via the routine ``pelelmex_initdata()``, in the file ``pelelmex_prob.H``. Additional information is provided as comments in this file for the eager reader, but nothing is required from the user at this point.

Numerical scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``PeleLM CONTROL`` block contains a few of the `PeleLMeX` algorithmic parameters. Many more
unspecified parameters are relying on their default values which can be found in :doc:`LMeXControls`.
Of particular interest are the ``peleLM.sdc_iterMax`` parameter controlling the number of
SDC iterations (see :doc:`Model` for more details on SDC in `PeleLMeX`) and the
``peleLM.num_init_iter`` one controlling the number of initial iteration the solver will do
after initialization to obtain a consistent pressure and velocity field.

Building the executable
-----------------------

Now that we have reviewed the basic ingredients required to setup the case, it is time to build the `PeleLMeX` executable.
Although both GNUmake and CMake are available, it is advised to use GNUmake. The ``GNUmakefile`` file provides some compile-time options
regarding the simulation we want to perform.
The first few lines specify the paths towards the source codes of `PeleLMeX`, `AMReX`, `AMReX-Hydro` and `PelePhysics`, overwriting
any environment variable if necessary, and might have been already updated in :ref:`sec:TUTO_TF::PrepStep` earlier.

The next few lines specify AMReX compilation options and compiler selection: ::

   # AMREX
   DIM             = 2
   DEBUG           = FALSE
   PRECISION       = DOUBLE
   VERBOSE         = FALSE
   TINY_PROFILE    = FALSE

   # Compilation
   COMP            = gnu
   USE_MPI         = TRUE
   USE_OMP         = FALSE
   USE_CUDA        = FALSE
   USE_HIP         = FALSE
   USE_SYCL        = FALSE

In `PeleLMeX`, the chemistry model (set of species, their thermodynamic and transport properties as well as the
description of their of chemical interactions) is specified at compile time. Chemistry models available
in `PelePhysics` can used in `PeleLMeX` by specifying the name of the folder in `PelePhysics/Mechanisms` containing
the relevant files, for example: ::

   Chemistry_Model = drm19

Here, the methane kinetic model ``drm19``, containing 21 species is employed. The user is referred to
the `PelePhysics <https://pelephysics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ documentation for a list of available
mechanisms and more information regarding the EOS, chemistry and transport models specified: ::

    Eos_Model       := Fuego
    Transport_Model := Simple

Finally, `PeleLMeX` utilizes the chemical kinetic ODE integrator `CVODE <https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvode>`_. This
Third Party Library (TPL) is shipped as a submodule of the `PeleLMeX` distribution and can be readily installed through the makefile system
of `PeleLMeX`. To do so, type in the following command: ::

    make TPL

Note that the installation of `CVODE` requires CMake 3.23.1 or higher.

You are now ready to build your first `PeleLMeX` executable !! Type in: ::

    make -j4

The option here tells `make` to use up to 4 processors to create the executable
(internally, `make` follows a dependency graph to ensure any required ordering in the build is satisfied).
This step should generate the following file (providing that the build configuration you used matches the one above): ::

    PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex

You're good to go !

Initial transient phase
----------------------------------

First step: the initial solution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When performing time-dependent numerical simulations, it is good practice to verify the initial solution. To do so,
we will run `PeleLMeX` to perform the initialization only, to generate an initial plotfile ``plt00000``.

Time-stepping parameters in ``input.2d-regt`` are specified in the ``Time Stepping`` block: ::

    #---------------------- Time Stepping CONTROL --------------------
    amr.max_step = 0                          # Maximum number of time steps
    amr.stop_time = 4.00                      # final simulation physical time
    amr.cfl = 0.2                             # CFL number for hyperbolic system
    amr.dt_shrink = 0.001                     # Scale back initial timestep
    amr.dt_change_max = 1.1                   # Maximum dt increase btw successive steps

The maximum number of time steps is set to 0 for now, while the final simulation time is 4.0 s. Note that,
when both ``max_step`` and ``stop_time`` are specified, the more stringent constraint will control the
termination of the simulation. `PeleLMeX` solves for the advection, diffusion and reaction processes in time,
but only the advection term is treated explicitly and thus it constrains the maximum time step size
:math:`dt_{CFL}`. This constraint is formulated with a classical Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) number,
specified via the keyword ``amr.cfl``. Additionally, as it is the case here, the initial solution is often made-up by
the user and local mixture composition and temperature can result in the introduction of unreasonably fast chemical scales.
To ease the numerical integration of this initial transient, the parameter ``amr.dt_shrink`` allows to shrink the initial `dt`
(evaluated from the CFL constraint) by a factor (usually smaller than 1), and let it relax towards :math:`dt_{CFL}` at
a rate given by ``amr.dt_change_max`` as the simulation proceeds.

Input/output from `PeleLMeX` are specified in the ``IO CONTROL`` block: ::

    #---------------------- IO CONTROL -------------------------------
    #amr.restart = chk01000                   # Restart checkpoint file
    amr.check_int = 2000                      # Frequency of checkpoint output
    amr.plot_int = 20                         # Frequency of pltfile output
    amr.derive_plot_vars = avg_pressure mag_vort mass_fractions mixture_fraction progress_variable

The first lines (commented out for now) are only used when restarting a simulation from a `checkpoint` file and
will be useful later during this tutorial. Information pertaining to the checkpoint and plot_file files name and output
frequency can be specified there (see :doc:`LMeXControls` for a complete list of available keys). `PeleLMeX` will always
generate an initial plotfile ``plt00000`` if the initialization is properly completed and plotfile IO is triggered,
and a final plotfile at the end of the simulation. It is possible to request including `derived variables` in the plotfiles
by appending their names to the ``amr.derive_plot_vars`` keyword. These variables are derived from the `state variables`
(velocity, density, temperature, :math:`\rho Y_k`, :math:`\rho h`) which are automatically included in the plotfile.

You finally have all the information necessary to run the first of several steps to generate a steady triple flame. Type in: ::

    ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d-regt

If you wish to store the standard output of `PeleLMeX` for later analysis, you can instead use: ::

    ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d-regt > logCheckInitialSolution.dat &

Whether you have used one or the other command, within 10 s you should obtain a ``plt00000`` file (or even more,
appended with .old*********** if you used both commands). Use `Amrvis <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Visualization.html>`_
to visualize ``plt00000`` and make sure the solution matches the one shown in Fig. :numref:`TF_InitialSol`.

Running the problem on a coarse grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above, the initial solution is relatively far from the steady-state triple flame we wish to obtain.
An inexpensive and rapid way to transition from the initial solution to an established triple flame is to perform
a coarse (using only 2 AMR levels) simulation using a single SDC iteration for a few initial number of time steps
(here we start with 1000). To do so, update (or verify !) these associated keywords in the ``input.2d-regt``: ::

    #---------------------- AMR CONTROL ------------------------------
    ...
    amr.max_level         = 1                 # maximum level number allowed
    ...
    #---------------------- Time Stepping CONTROL --------------------
    ...
    amr.max_step          = 1000              # maximum number of time steps
    ...
    #---------------------- PeleLM CONTROL ---------------------------
    ...
    peleLM.sdc_iterMax    = 1                 # Number of SDC iterations

To be able to complete this first step relatively quickly, it is advised to run `PeleLM` using at least 4 MPI processes if possible.
It will then take around 10 mn to reach completion. To be able to monitor the simulation while it is running, use the following command: ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d-regt > logCheckInitialTransient.dat &

A plotfile is generated every 20 time steps (as specified via the ``amr.plot_int`` keyword in the ``IO CONTROL`` block). This will
allow you to visualize and monitor the evolution of the flame. Use the following command to open multiple plotfiles at once
with `Amrvis <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/Visualization.html>`_: ::

    amrvis -a plt????0

An animation of the flame evolution during the entire tutorial, including this initial transient, is provided in :numref:`TF_InitTransient`.

   :figwidth: 95%

   : Temperature (left) and divu (right) fields from 0 to 2000 time steps (0-?? ms).

Steady-state problem: activating the flame control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The speed of propagation of a triple flame is not easy to determine a-priori. As such it is useful,
at least until the flame settles, to have some sort of stabilization mechanism to prevent
flame blow-off or flashback. In the present configuration, the position of the flame front can be tracked
at each time step (using an isoline of temperature) and the input velocity is adjusted to maintain
its location at a fixed distance from the inlet (1 cm in the present case).

The parameters of the active control are listed in `AC CONTROL` block of ``input.2d-regt``: ::

    #---------------------- AC CONTROL -------------------------------
    active_control.on = 1                     # Use AC ?
    active_control.use_temp = 1               # Default in fuel mass, rather use iso-T position ?
    active_control.temperature = 1400.0       # Value of iso-T ?
    active_control.tau = 1.0e-4               # Control tau (should ~ 10 dt)
    active_control.height = 0.01              # Where is the flame held ? Default assumes coordinate along Y in 2D or Z in 3D.
    active_control.v = 1                      # verbose
    active_control.velMax = 2.0               # Optional: limit inlet velocity
    active_control.changeMax = 0.1            # Optional: limit inlet velocity changes (absolute m/s)
    active_control.flow_dir  = 1              # Optional: flame main direction. Default: AMREX_SPACEDIM-1
    active_control.pseudo_gravity = 1         # Optional: add density proportional force to compensate for the acceleration
                                              #           of the gas due to inlet velocity changes

The first keyword activates the active control and the second one specify that the flame will be tracked
based on an iso-line of temperature, the value of which is provided in the third keyword. The following parameters
control the relaxation of the inlet velocity to the steady state velocity of the triple flame. ``tau`` is a relaxation time scale,
that should be of the order of ten times the simulation time-step. ``height`` is the user-defined location where the
triple flame should settle, ``changeMax`` and ``velMax`` control the maximum velocity increment and maximum inlet velocity, respectively.
The user is referred to [CAMCS2006]_ for an overview of the method and corresponding parameters.
The ``pseudo_gravity`` triggers a manufactured force added to the momentum equation to compensate for the acceleration of different density gases.

Once these parameters are set, you continue the previous simulation by uncommenting the first line of the ``IO CONTROL`` block in the input file: ::

    amr.restart           = chk01000 # Restart checkpoint file

On this line, provide the last `checkpoint` file generated during the first simulation performed for 1000 time steps.
Finally, update the ``amr.max_step`` to allow the simulation to proceed further: ::

    #---------------------- Time Stepping CONTROL --------------------
    ...
    amr.max_step          = 2000          # maximum number of time steps

You are now ready launch `PeleLMeX` again for another 1000 time steps ! ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs.2d-regt > logCheckControl.dat &

As the simulation proceeds, an ASCII file tracking the flame position and inlet velocity
(as well as other control variables) is generated: ``AC_History``. You can follow the motion of
the flame tip by plotting the seventh column against the first one (flame tip vs. time step count).
If `gnuplot` is available on your computer, use the following to obtain the graphs of :numref:`TF_ACcontrol`: ::

    gnuplot
    plot "AC_History.dat" u 1:7 w lp
    plot "AC_History.dat" u 1:3 w lp
    exit

The second plot corresponds to the inlet velocity.

.. figure:: images/tutorials/TF_ACcontrol.png
   :name: TF_ACcontrol
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 95%

   : Flame tip position (left) and inlet velocity (right) as function of time step count from 1000 to 2000 step using the inlet velocity control.

At this point, you have a stabilized methane/air triple flame and will now use AMR features to improve the quality of your simulation.

Refinement of the computation
-----------------------------

Before going further, it is important to look at the results of the current simulation. The left panel of :numref:`TF_CoarseDetails`
displays the temperature field, while a zoom-in of the flame edge region colored by several important variables
is provided on the right side.
Note that `DivU`, the `HeatRelease` and the `CH4_consumption` are good markers of the reaction/diffusion processes in our case.
What is striking from these images is the lack of resolution of the triple flame, particularly in the reaction zone.
We also clearly see square unsmooth shapes in the field of intermediate species, where `Y(HCO)` is found to
closely match the region of high `CH4_consumption` while `Y(CH3O)` is located closer to the cold gases, on the outer layer of the triple flame.

.. figure:: images/tutorials/TF_CoarseDetails.png
   :name: TF_CoarseDetails
   :align: center
   :figwidth: 95%

   : Details of the triple flame tip obtained with the initial coarse 2-level mesh.

Our additional level of refinement must specifically target the reactive layer of the flame. As seen
from :numref:`TF_CoarseDetails`, one can choose from several variables to reach that goal. In the following,
we will use the CH3O species as a tracer of the flame position. Start by increasing the number of AMR levels by one
in the `AMR CONTROL` block: ::

    #---------------------- AMR CONTROL ------------------------------
    ...
    amr.max_level       = 2          # maximum level number allowed

Then provide a definition of the new refinement criteria in the `Refinement CONTROL` block: ::

    #---------------------- Refinement CONTROL------------------------
    amr.refinement_indicators = highT gradT flame_tracer   # Declare set of refinement indicators

    amr.highT.max_level     = 1
    amr.highT.value_greater = 800
    amr.highT.field_name    = temp

    amr.gradT.max_level                   = 1
    amr.gradT.adjacent_difference_greater = 200
    amr.gradT.field_name                  = temp

    amr.flame_tracer.max_level     = 2
    amr.flame_tracer.value_greater = 1.0e-6
    amr.flame_tracer.field_name    = Y(CH3O)

The first line simply declares a set of refinement indicators which are subsequently defined. For each indicator,
users can provide a limit up to which AMR level this indicator will be used to refine. Then there are multiple possibilities
to specify the actual criterion: ``value_greater``, ``value_less``, ``vorticity_greater`` or ``adjacent_difference_greater``.
In each case, the user specify a threshold value and the name of variable on which it applies (except for the ``vorticity_greater``).
In the example above, the grid is refined up to level 1 at the location wheres the temperature is above 800 K or where the temperature
difference between adjacent cells exceed 200 K. These two criteria were used up to that point. The last indicator will now enable
to add level 2 grid patches at location where the flame tracer (`Y(CH3O)`) is above 1.0e-6.

With these new parameters, update the `checkpoint` file from which to restart: ::

    amr.restart           = chk02000 # Restart checkpoint file

and increase the ``amr.max_step`` to 2500 and start the simulation again ! ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d-regt > log3Levels.dat &

Visualization of the 3-levels simulation results indicates that the flame front is now better represented on the fine grid,
but there are still only a couple of cells across the flame front thickness. The flame tip velocity, captured in the `AC_history`, also
exhibits a significant change with the addition of the third level (even past the initial transient). In the present case,
the flame tip velocity is our main quantity of interest and we will now add another refinement level to ensure that this quantity
is fairly well captured. We will use the same refinement indicators and simply update the ``amr.max_level`` as well as the level
at which each refinement criteria is used: ::

    amr.max_level         = 3          # maximum level number allowed

    ...

    amr.restart           = chk02300 # Restart from checkpoint ?

    ...

    amr.gradT.max_level   = 2

    ...

    amr.flame_tracer.max_level  = 3

and increase the ``amr.max_step`` to 3000. Within `PeleLMeX` non-subcycling time advance, the step size is decreasing as we increase the number of AMR
levels. We started with a rather small CFL number of 0.2 to avoid numerical issues associated with coarse simulations and large time step size
(see :doc:`Tutorials_BFSFlame` more a practical example of integration failure). Additionally, as our step size decreases, the `tau` parameter of the
active control becomes comparatively larger, resulting in slower response of the adapted inlet velocity to flame position changes. Let's increase the
CFL number of 0.3, reduce `tau` and add a second SDC iteration to tighten the coupling between the various processes: ::

    peleLM.sdc_iterMax = 2

    ...

    amr.cfl = 0.3

    ...

    active_control.tau = 1.0e-4            # Control tau (should ~ 10 dt)

Let's start the simulation again ! ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLM2d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs.2d-regt > log4Levels.dat &

Figure :numref:`TF_ACcomplete` shows the entire history of the inlet velocity starting when
the AC was activated (1000th time step). We can see that every change in the numerical setup induced a slight change in the
triple flame propagation velocity, eventually leading to a nearly constant value, sufficient for the purpose of this tutorial.

At this point, the simulation is considered complete.
