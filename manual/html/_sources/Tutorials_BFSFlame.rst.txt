Backward facing step anchored premixed flame
============================================

.. _sec:TUTO_BFS::Intro:

Introduction
------------

The primary objective of `PeleLMeX` is to enable simulations of reactive flows on platforms ranging
from small personal computers to Exascale supercomputers. This ``EB_BackwardStepFlame`` tutorial describes the case
of a 2D laminar premixed methane/air flame anchored behind a backward facing step.

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce `PeleLMeX` users to more advanced reactive simulation setup as
well as embedded boundaries.

Case setup
----------

A `PeleLMeX` case folder generally contains a minimal set of files to enable compilation,
and the reader is referred to the FlameSheet tutorial :doc:`Tutorials_FlameSheet` for a
more detailed description of `PeleLMeX` case setup. The case of interest for this
tutorial can be found in `PeleLMeX` Exec folder: ::

    Exec/RegTests/EB_BackwardStepFlame

Geometry, grid and boundary conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This simulation is performed on a 0.08x0.02 :math:`m^2` 2D computational domain,
with the bottom left corner located at (-0.01:-0.01) and the top right corner at (0.07:0.01). The flow
is primarily aligned with the :math:`x` direction with an ``Inflow`` (dirichlet) boundary on the :math:`x`-low
and ``Outflow`` (0-neumann) boundary on :math:`x`-high. No-slip wall conditions are imposed the transverse direction.
Finally a Cartesian coordinate system is used here. An overview of the computational domain is provided in :numref:`BFS_SetupGeom`.

   : Setup of the computational domain for the backward facing step flame case.

All of the geometrical information can be specified the first two blocks of the input file (`input.2d`): ::

   #---------------------- DOMAIN DEFINITION ------------------------
   geometry.is_periodic = 0 0                  # For each dir, 0: non-perio, 1: periodic
   geometry.coord_sys   = 0                    # 0 => cart, 1 => RZ
   geometry.prob_lo     = -0.01   -0.01        # x_lo y_lo (z_lo)
   geometry.prob_hi     =  0.07    0.01        # x_hi y_hi (z_hi)

   #---------------------- BC FLAGS ---------------------------------
   # Interior, Inflow, Outflow, Symmetry,
   # SlipWallAdiab, NoSlipWallAdiab, SlipWallIsotherm, NoSlipWallIsotherm
   peleLM.lo_bc = Inflow  NoSlipWallAdiab      # bc in x_lo y_lo (z_lo)
   peleLM.hi_bc = Outflow NoSlipWallAdiab      # bc in x_hi y_hi (z_hi)

.. note::
    Note that when running 2D simulations, it is not necessary to specify entries for the third dimension.

The base grid is decomposed into a 256x64 cell array with AMR initially not activated.

The refinement ratio between each level is set to 2 and `PeleLMeX` currently does not support
refinement ratio of 4. Regrid operation will be performed every 5 steps. ``amr.n_error_buf`` specifies,
for each level, the number of buffer cells used around the cell tagged for refinement, while ``amr.grid_eff``
describes the grid efficiency, i.e. how much of the new grid contains tagged cells. Higher values lead
to tighter grids around the tagged cells. For more information on how these parameters affect grid generation,
see the `AMReX documentation <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/GridCreation.html>`_.

All of those parameters are specified in the `AMR CONTROL` block: ::

   #------------------------- AMR CONTROL ----------------------------
   amr.n_cell          = 256 64           # Level 0 number of cells in each direction
   amr.max_level       = 0                # maximum level number allowed
   amr.ref_ratio       = 2 2 2 2          # refinement ratio
   amr.regrid_int      = 5                # how often to regrid
   amr.n_error_buf     = 2 2 2 2          # number of buffer cells in error est
   amr.grid_eff        = 0.7              # what constitutes an efficient grid
   amr.blocking_factor = 16               # block factor in grid generation
   amr.max_grid_size   = 64               # maximum box size


Finally, this case uses Embedded Boundaries to represent the backward facing step. The EB is
defined as a box on the lower-left corner of the domain. For such an easy geometry,
a single `AMReX native constructive solid geometry (CSG) <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/EB.html#implicit-function>`_ object is sufficient.
The box will extend from a point beyond
the computational domain bottom left corner to (0.01:0.0). Because the intersection of the
EB with the computational grid can lead to arbitrarily small cells, AMReX provides
``eb2.small_volfrac`` to set a cell volume fraction limit below which a cell
is considered fully covered. In the present simulation, we will treat the EB
as an isothermal boundary, with control over the wall temperature described in the
next section.

::

   #---------------------- EB SETUP ---------------------------------
   eb2.geom_type = box
   eb2.box_lo =    -0.02   -0.02
   eb2.box_hi =     0.01     0.0
   eb2.box_has_fluid_inside = 0
   eb2.small_volfrac   = 1.0e-4
   peleLM.isothermal_EB = 1

.. note::
    When EBs intersect with the domain boundary, it is important to ensure that
    the EB definition extends slightly beyond the domain boundaries to provide
    EB structure data in the domain ghost cells.


Problem specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  _sec:TUTO_BFS::Problem:

The problem setup is mostly contained in the three C++ source/header files described in :doc:`Tutorials_FlameSheet`.
The user parameters are gathered in the struct defined in  ``pelelmex_prob_parm.H``: ::

    struct ProbParm
    {
        amrex::Real T_mean = 298.0_rt;
        amrex::Real P_mean = 101325.0_rt;
        amrex::Real Y_fuel = 0.0445_rt;
        amrex::Real Y_o2   = 0.223_rt;
        amrex::Real T_hot  = 1800.0_rt;
        amrex::Real Twall  = 300.0_rt;
        amrex::Real meanFlowMag = 0.0;

    };

* ``T_mean`` : inlet and initial gas temperature

* ``P_mean`` : initial thermodynamic pressure

* ``Y_fuel`` : inlet and initial fuel (CH4) mass fraction

* ``Y_oxid`` : inlet and initial oxidizer (O2) mass fraction

* ``T_hot`` : initial temperature in the step wake

* ``T_wall`` : EB-wall temperature

* ``meanFlowMag`` : inlet :math:`x` velocity


The initial solution consists of a premixed methane/air mixture in the upper part of the domain
and pure hot air in the wake of the step. The default parameters provided above are overwritten
using AMReX ParmParse in ``pelelmex_prob.cpp`` and the initial/boundary conditions implemented in
``pelelmex_prob.H``. Alternatively, the user can write a custom function to enforce an ignition kernel through the ``patchFlowVariables`` function in the problem-specific ``PeleLMeX_PatchFlowVariables.cpp`` file. 
It should be kept in mind that the ``patchFlowVariables`` function can be used if the user wants to patch certain flow variables after reading an existing solution from a plot file ( ``peleLM.do_patch_flow_variables`` should be set to true).

In addition to these three C++ files, an extra header is needed in the present case compared to
:doc:`Tutorials_FlameSheet` : ``EBUserDefined.H``. This file is necessary to specify more complex EB
geometries (not the case here) and to prescribe EB isothermal wall condition. It contains three functions:

* ``EBUserDefined()`` : can be used to provide a user-defined geometry. It is left empty in the present case.

* ``setEBState()`` : takes in the EB face center coordinates and return a vector for the entire state vector. For
  isothermal walls, only the ``TEMP`` component is required.

* ``setEBType()`` : even though ``peleLM.isothermal_EB=1`` is activated, the user can locally decide to use
  an adiabatic wall on part of the EB. To do so, this function takes in the EB face center coordinates
  and return a ``Real`` flag that should be set to 1.0 on isothermal areas and 0.0 on adiabatic areas. The
  flag is later used to pre-multiply the thermal diffusivity effectively zeroing the thermal flux where the flag
  is 0.0.

In the present case, we set the EB temperature to ``T_wall`` everywhere on the EB in ``setEBState()`` but
the EB flag is only set to 1.0 on the vertical EB faces (:math:`x` normal) such that the top of the EB box
is adiabatic.


Numerical parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``PeleLM CONTROL`` block contains a few of the `PeleLMeX` algorithmic parameters. Many more
unspecified parameters are relying on their default values which can be found in :doc:`LMeXControls`.
Of particular interest are the ``peleLM.sdc_iterMax`` parameter controlling the number of
SDC iterations (see :doc:`Model` for more details on SDC in `PeleLMeX`) and the
``peleLM.num_init_iter`` one controlling the number of initial iteration the solver will do
after initialization to obtain a consistent pressure and velocity field.

Building the executable
-----------------------

Now that we have reviewed the basic ingredients required to setup the case, it is time to build the `PeleLMeX` executable.
Although both GNUmake and CMake are available, it is advised to use GNUmake. The ``GNUmakefile`` file provides some compile-time options
regarding the simulation we want to perform.
The first few lines specify the paths towards the source codes of `PeleLMeX`, `AMReX`, `AMReX-Hydro` and `PelePhysics`, overwriting
any environment variable if necessary, and might have been already updated in :ref:`sec:TUTO_BFS::PrepStep` earlier.

The next few lines specify AMReX compilation options and compiler selection: ::

   # AMREX
   DIM             = 2
   DEBUG           = FALSE
   PRECISION       = DOUBLE
   VERBOSE         = FALSE
   TINY_PROFILE    = FALSE
   USE_EB          = TRUE
   USE_HYPRE       = FALSE

   # Compilation
   COMP            = gnu
   USE_MPI         = TRUE
   USE_OMP         = FALSE
   USE_CUDA        = FALSE
   USE_HIP         = FALSE
   USE_SYCL        = FALSE

It allows users to specify the number of spatial dimensions (2D), activate the compilation of the EB aware AMReX source code,
trigger debug compilation and other AMReX options. The compiler (``gnu``) and the parallelism paradigm
(in the present case only MPI is used) are then selected. Note that on OSX platform, one should update the compiler to ``llvm``.

The user also needs to make sure the additional C++ header employed to define the EB state is included in the build: ::

   # PeleLMeX
   CEXE_headers    += EBUserDefined.H

In `PeleLMeX`, the chemistry model (set of species, their thermodynamic and transport properties as well as the description
of their of chemical interactions) is specified at compile time. Chemistry models available in
`PelePhysics` can used in `PeleLMeX` by specifying the name of the folder in `PelePhysics/Mechanisms` containing
the relevant files, for example: ::

   Chemistry_Model = drm19

Here, the model ``drm19`` contains 21 species and describe the chemical decomposition of methane.
The user is referred to the `PelePhysics <https://pelephysics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ documentation for a
list of available mechanisms and more information regarding the EOS, chemistry and transport models specified: ::

    Eos_Model       := Fuego
    Transport_Model := Simple

Finally, `PeleLMeX` utilizes the chemical kinetic ODE integrator `CVODE <https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/cvode>`_. This
Third Party Library (TPL) is shipped as a submodule of the `PeleLMeX` distribution and can be readily installed through the makefile system
of `PeleLMeX`. To do so, type in the following command: ::

    make -j4 TPL

Note that the installation of `CVODE` requires CMake 3.23.1 or higher.

You are now ready to build your first `PeleLMeX` executable!! Type in: ::

    make -j4

The option here tells `make` to use up to 4 processors to create the executable (internally, `make` follows a dependency graph to ensure any required ordering in the build is satisfied). This step should generate the following file (providing that the build configuration you used matches the one above): ::

    PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex

You're good to go!

Checking the initial conditions
-------------------------------

It is always a good practice to check the initial conditions. To do so, run the simulation specifying
an ``amr.max_step`` of 0. Open the ``input.2d`` with your favorite editor and update the following parameters ::

    #---------------------- Time Stepping CONTROL --------------------
    amr.max_step      = 0             # Maximum number of time steps


Since we've set the maximum number of steps to 0, the solver will exit after
the initial solution is obtained. Let's run the simulation with the default problem parameter
listed in the input file. To do so, use: ::

    ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d-regt

A variety of information is printed to the screen:

#. AMReX/SUNDIALs initialization along with the git hashes of the various subrepositories

#. A summary of the `PeleLMeX` state components

#. Initial projection and initial iterations.

#. Saving the initial solution to `plt00000` file.

Use Amrvis, Paraview or yt to visualize the plot file. Using Amrvis, the solution should look
similar to :numref:`BFS_InitSol`.

   : Contour plots of temperature, O2 mass fraction, :math:`x`-velocity component and divergence constraint after initialization.

Note that in `PeleLMeX`, EB-covered regions are set to zero in plotfiles. Hot gases are found in the wake
of the EB as expected, with a slightly higher O2 mass fraction compared to the upper part of the domain
where CH4 is present in the mixture. The velocity field results from the initial projection, which uses
the divergence constraint. The later is negative close to the isothermal EB because the cold EB leads
to an increase of density. `divU` is also non zero at the interface between the incoming fresh gases and
the hot air due to heat diffusion.

Advance the solution on coarse grid
-----------------------------------

Let's now advance the solution for 250 steps, using only the base grid and the default time stepping
parameters. To do so, ensure that: ::

    amr.max_step = 250

Additionally, make sure that ``amr.check_int`` is set to a positive value to trigger writing a
checkpoint file from which to later restart the simulation. If available, use more than one MPI
rank to run the simulation and redirect the standard output to a log file using: ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d > logInitCoarse.dat &

Using 4 MPI ranks, it takes about 200 seconds to complete.
A typical `PeleLMeX` stdout for a time step now looks like: ::

    ====================   NEW TIME STEP   ====================
    Est. time step - Conv: 9.42747435e-06, divu: 0.0002752479251
    STEP [125] - Time: 5.072407773e-05, dt 5.072441746e-06
      SDC iter [1]
      SDC iter [2]
    >> PeleLM::Advance() --> Time: 0.877052

clearly showing the use of 2 SDC iterations. The first line at each step provides
the time step constraint from the CFL
condition (``Conv:``) and from the density change condition (``divu:``).
Since an initial ``dt_shrink`` was applied upon initialization, the
current step is smaller than the CFL but progressively increases
over the course of the simulation, eventually reaching the CFL constrained
step size after 133 steps. After 250 steps, the simulation time is around 1.25 ms and
the step size is of the order of 10 :math:`\mu s`.

Visualizing the `plt00250` file, we can see that the solution has evolved, with a
vortex propagating downstream along the flame surface, while intermediate species
can be found. Looking at the heat release rate and the H2 mass fraction, we can see that
the flame front is very poorly resolved. The density along the isothermal EB also increased under
the effect of the cold wall.

   :align: center
   :figwidth: 95%

   : Contour plots of density, H2 mass fraction, :math:`x`-velocity component and heat release rate after 250 steps.

In order to illustrate one of `PeleLMeX` failure modes, we will now continue the simulation for
another 50 steps, starting from `chk00250`, while increasing the CFL number to 0.6. Update the
following keys in the input file: ::

    #---------------------- Time Stepping CONTROL --------------------
    amr.max_step = 300                          # Maximum number of time steps
    ...
    amr.cfl = 0.6                               # CFL number for hyperbolic system

    ...
    #---------------------- IO CONTROL -------------------------------
    amr.restart = chk00250                      # Restart checkpoint file

and restart the simulation: ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d > logFail.dat &

The simulation will proceed, with the step size progressively increasing due to the higher CFL
and changes to the velocity field, but after ~30 steps `PeleLMeX` will fail with the following error: ::

    ====================   NEW TIME STEP   ====================
    Est. time step - Conv: 1.550410967e-05, divu: 5.712875519e-05

    amrex::Abort::3::Aborting from CVODE !!!
    SIGABRT
    From CVODE: At t = 1.43329e-05, mxstep steps taken before reaching tout.

The combination of large time step size and poor flame resolution leads to a very stiff chemical system,
where fuel, oxidizer, intermediate species and heat are mixed within the cell averaged state representation
associated with finite volume. The CVODE error clearly states that the internal sub-stepping of the ODE
integrator was not able to integrate past 1.43329e-05. This is an indication that the CFL constraint
is too loose compared to chemical stiffness, even though a implicit solve is performed. This generally occurs
in laminar flows with coarse resolution, but could also occurs in midly turbulent flames with stiff
chemical mechanisms. If you plan on pushing the simulation forward without adding refinement, it is advised
to reduce CFL to smaller value.

Refine the simulation
---------------------

Instead, let's add a first level of refinement and keep the CFL at a value of 0.6, while restarting again from
`chk00250`. Enable AMR refinement by increasing the ``amr.max_level``: ::

    #---------------------- AMR CONTROL ------------------------------
    ...
    amr.max_level       = 1                     # maximum level number allowed
    ...

And increase the maximum number of steps to 500: ::

    #---------------------- Time Stepping CONTROL --------------------
    amr.max_step = 500                          # Maximum number of time steps
    ...

Restart the simulation: ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d > log1AMR.dat &

Using 4 MPI ranks, the simulation takes approximately 13 mn, so plenty of time to get
a warm beverage. Looking at the solution after 500 steps (~3.2 ms), fine boxes can be found
around the EB and along the flame. This is consistent with `PeleLMeX` default behavior which consists
of refining the EB up to the finest level, and the refinement criterion specified in the
`Refinement CONTROL` block near the end of the input file: ::

    #---------------------- Refinement CONTROL------------------------
    amr.refinement_indicators = gradT
    amr.gradT.max_level     = 3
    amr.gradT.adjacent_difference_greater = 100
    amr.gradT.field_name    = temp

This input block triggers cell tagging for refinement if the adjacent cell in any directions has a
temperature difference larger than 100 K. Because the of the blocking factor and the grid efficiency
value, most of the lower part of the computational domain is actually refined to Level 1.

   :align: center
   :figwidth: 95%

   : Contour plots of temperature, H2 mass fraction, chemistry functCall and heat release rate after 500 steps, using 1 level of AMR.

The `functCall` variable corresponds to the number of time CVODE called the chemical right-hand-side function and is
a good indicator of the computational cost of the integration of the implicit chemical system. Values up to ~70 can
be found in the vicinity of the flame front while values < 10 are found outside of the flame, highligthind the high
spatial heterogeneity of combustion simulations. Even though a flame has established, the recirculation zone in the
wake of the backward facing step is still mostly filled with the initial hot air mixture. Let's restart the simulation again
for another 500 steps using the same setup, only adding a few extra parameters:

* increase `PeleLMeX` verbose ``peleLM.v = 2`` is order to get more information about the advance function.

* add following to the list of derived variables stored in plotfile (``amr.derive_plot_vars``): `mixture_fraction`, `progress_variable`.

In order for the mixture fraction and progress variable to be properly define, users must provide the
composition of the `fuel` and `oxidizer` streams, and the `cold` and `hot` mixture states, respectively. To do so,
update the following block: ::

    #---------------------- Derived CONTROLS -------------------------
    peleLM.fuel_name = CH4
    peleLM.mixtureFraction.format = Cantera
    peleLM.mixtureFraction.type   = mass
    peleLM.mixtureFraction.oxidTank = O2:0.233 N2:0.767
    peleLM.mixtureFraction.fuelTank = CH4:1.0
    peleLM.progressVariable.format = Cantera
    peleLM.progressVariable.weights = CO:1.0 CO2:1.0
    peleLM.progressVariable.coldState = CO:0.0 CO2:0.0
    peleLM.progressVariable.hotState = CO:0.003 CO2:0.122

Update the ``amr.restart`` and ``amr.max_step`` to `chk00500` and `1000`, respectively and restart the simulation: ::

    mpirun -n 4 ./PeleLMeX2d.gnu.MPI.ex input.2d > log1AMRcnt.dat &

Once again, the simulation takes approximately 30 mn to complete. At this point, the flame is fairly well established
in the downstream part of the domain, but the `mixture_fraction` field can clearly show that hot air is still trapped
in the recirculation. Because of the cold EB wall, the flame is detached from the EB wall and stabilized by an
ignition mechanism in the shear layer between the incoming fressh, flammable mixture and the recirculated hot gases.
A look at the heat release rate field will show that the flame is still highly under-resolved. Let's continue the
simulation with an additional level of refinement. However, we could now want to keep the next level on the flame
only. However, AMReX (and thus `PeleLMeX`) does not enable coarse-fine boundaries to intersect the EB. In other
words, a continuous EB surface must be at the same level. But this level doesn't have to be the finest level
used in the simulation. In order to control the EB refinement level, let's add the following lines to the
`Refinement CONTROL` block: ::

    peleLM.refine_EB_type = Static
    peleLM.refine_EB_max_level = 1
    peleLM.refine_EB_buffer = 2.0

These input keys will initiate a de-refining mechanism where local refinement triggered by other tagging criterions
will be removed above the level specified (`1` in the present case), preventing coarse-fine boundary from intersecting
the EB. The last keyword is a factor controlling how far from the EB the de-refining is applied is is useful for deep
AMR hierarchy with complex geometries where proper nesting of finer levels might extend the reach of an AMR level far
beyond the region where tagging for that level is triggered. Because `PeleLMeX` operates without subcycling, the
step size decreases as we add refinement levels. As such, we can increase slightly the CFL number (but no higher than
0.9) because we will now advance at a step size much small than the ones where we experienced CVODE integration
issues earlier in this tutorial. Let's set ``amr.cfl=0.7``, increase the ``amr.max_level=2`` and restart the simulation
for another 200 steps (updating again the restart file and max step).

The simulation with take about 22 mn on 4 MPI ranks. A typical log file step with regridding will look like: ::

      - Advance()::VelocityAdvance  --> Time: 0.325139
    >> PeleLM::Advance() --> Time: 7.528655

The increased verbose explicitly shows the various pieces of `PeleLMeX` advance function and their computational
cost. In the present case, diffusion and reaction are about the same computational cost, 5 to 10 times more expensive
than the other parts of the algorithm. Both AMR levels where updated at the beginning of the time steps. With the
additional refinement, the flame front is now resolved with a few grid cells (but still below DNS requirements).

The AMR level 2 is clearly distant from the EB and concentrated mostly on the flame surface (except a small box at the bottom of the
recirculation zone which could be alleviated by using a refinement criterion based a flame intermediate species rather
than temperature difference). Let's conclude this tutorial by another two AMR levels and provide an example of `PeleLMeX`
runtime diagnostics. We will restart the simulation for another 10 steps with a ``amr.max_level=3``. increasing the
verbose to ``peleLM.v = 3`` and defining a couple of diagnostics.

We are interested in evaluating how much the premixed flame near the EB wall differs from the one further downstream. To provide
quantitative data, we will compute conditional averaged value of reaction markers and intermediate species as function of the
progress variable. We can do this by defining the same diagnostics but extracted on the upstream and downstream regions of the
computational domain as follows: ::

   peleLM.diagnostics = CondMeanUp CondMeanDown
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.type = DiagConditional
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.int  = 10
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.filters = lowX middleY
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.lowX.field_name = x
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.lowX.value_inrange = 0.011 0.035
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.middleY.field_name = y
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.middleY.value_inrange = -0.005 0.005
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.conditional_type = Average
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.nBins = 40
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.condition_field_name = progress_variable
   peleLM.CondMeanUp.field_names = HeatRelease Y(H2) Y(CO) I_R(CH4) I_R(H2)

   peleLM.CondMeanDown.type = DiagConditional
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.int  = 10
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.filters = highX middleY
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.highX.field_name = x
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.highX.value_inrange = 0.035 0.07
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.middleY.field_name = y
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.middleY.value_inrange = -0.005 0.005
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.conditional_type = Average
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.nBins = 40
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.condition_field_name = progress_variable
   peleLM.CondMeanDown.field_names = HeatRelease Y(H2) Y(CO) I_R(CH4) I_R(H2)

Using different ``filters`` option, the first diagnostic will extract data from the region comprised in the
:math:`x` [0.011:0.035] while the second one further downstream in :math:`x` [0.035:0.07].

Let's restart the simulation for another 10 steps (updating the restart file and max step). The additional
verbose allows to get an idea of the number of cells in the simulation: ::

   ====================   NEW TIME STEP   ====================
   Regridding...
   Remaking level 1
   with 37120 cells, over 56.640625% of the domain
   Remaking level 2
   with 67072 cells, over 25.5859375% of the domain
   Remaking level 3
   with 117760 cells, over 11.23046875% of the domain
   Making new level 4 from coarse
   with 189696 cells, over 4.522705078% of the domain
   Resetting fine-covered cells mask
   Est. time step - Conv: 1.221962099e-06, divu: 3.340072395e-05
   STEP [1205] - Time: 0.008871299457, dt 1.221962099e-06
   ...

Showing that the finest level contains as many cells as the next two coarser levels on only a fraction
of the space. Two additional ASCII files containing the conditional averaged data have been created and
using for example `gnuplot`, the user can compare the conditional averaged heat release rate between
the upstream and downstream region of the flame.

Note that for this analysis to be relevant, we would need to run the simulation longer to completely
remove the effect of the initial hot air still trapped in the recirculation zone at this point and largely
affecting the upstream average data.
