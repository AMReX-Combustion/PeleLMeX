This is the decaying 3D Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence test case,
originally implemented in PeleC and used to study compressible turbulence in:

The script gen_hit_ic.py from PelePhysics/Support/TurbFileHIT can be used to generate an initial solution.

Here, there is no scaling by the turbulent Mach number and the density is kept constant, so that the Taylor-scale Reynolds number is defined by Re=0.5 urms / nu where umrs can be set in the input file (prob.urms0=...) and nu is computed from the mixture composition.

At the beginning of a simulation, a file initialConditions.txt is created to hold the values of urms0, lambda0 and tau, which will be used for post-processing.
