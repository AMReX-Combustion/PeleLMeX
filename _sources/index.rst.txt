   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PeleLMeX's documentation!
====================================

`PeleLMeX` is the non-subcycling version of `PeleLM <https://amrex-combustion.github.io/PeleLM/>`_, an adaptive-mesh low Mach number hydrodynamics 
code for reacting flows. If you need help or have questions, please join the users `forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pelelmusers>`_.
The documentation pages appearing here are distributed with the code in the ``Docs`` folder as "restructured text" files.  The html is built
automatically with certain pushes to the `PeleLMeX` GibHub repository. A local version can also be built as follows ::

    cd ${PELELMEX_HOME}/Docs
    make html

where ``PELELMEX_HOME`` is the location of your clone of the `PeleLMeX` repository.  To view the local pages,
point your web browser at the file ``${PELELMEX_HOME}/Docs/build/html/index.html``.
